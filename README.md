# Dynamic To Do List


## About
The **To Do List** allows users to not ony add new items with ease, but it also lets them cross of tasks as they are completed. The list has three set goals to being with, but users can add how many ever more they want using the last row on the list and clicking the '**+**' when they are ready. 

## Visit the Site
Here is a live version of the **[To Do List](https://lovely-glacier-52340-5dc48c5cb0c8.herokuapp.com/ "To Do List")** that was launched through the Heroku service. 


## Multiple Pages
This is the main page that the user sees

## Origins 
I learnt the concepts of a To Do List through Dr. Angela Yu's **[Web Developement Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/ "Web Developement Bootcamp")** on Udemy, and I  went on to modify the Web App by:
1. Adding additional pages
2. Adding a background
3. Including a nav bar 


## Functionality
This Web App uses the following features:
1. node.js
2. ejs
3. JavaScript
4. HTML & CSS
   
## Downloading and customizing

Apart from the files that I have uploaded in the repository, you will also need to install:
1. node.js which you can download [here](https://nodejs.org/en "Node JS Download")
2. Once you have node.js on your system, open the command line and navigate to where you have saved the Dynamic To Do List files. Then enter the following commands to install: *express.js* and *body parser*
   ```
   npm init
   npm i express body-parser 
   ```

Once you have completed those commands,  you will be able to run your own version of this Dynamic To Do List on your own local server
